This Shiny web application displays the probability of each 3 card hand for the board game
Secret Hitler. The game uses a 17 deck made up of 6 Liberal and 11 Facist cards with a discard 
pile. Hence, the without replacement probabilities are calculated conditional on the cards that 
have been used.  The cards on the board are visible to all players, while the cards in the discard
were only visilbe to the players that used them.
